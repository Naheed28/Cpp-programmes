See the picture below.



You are given AB, AC and BC. DE is parallel to BC. You are also given the area ratio 
between ADE and BDEC. You have to find the value of AD.

Input
Input starts with an integer T (â‰¤ 25), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case begins with four real numbers denoting AB, AC, BC and the ratio of ADE and 
BDEC (ADE / BDEC). You can safely assume that the given triangle is a valid triangle with 
positive area.

Output
For each case of input you have to print the case number and AD. Errors less than 10-6 will be 
ignored.

Sample Input:
4

100 100 100 2

10 12 14 1

7 8 9 10

8.134 9.098 7.123 5.10


Output :
Case 1: 81.6496580

Case 2: 7.07106781

Case 3: 6.6742381247

Case 4: 7.437454786



hint:Let, Area of ADE = m and Area of BDEC = n, so Area of ABC = m+n;

Then, AD = sqrt(m/(m+n)) * AB;
