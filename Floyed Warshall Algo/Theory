Implementation
The advantage of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm that it is easy to implement. The
following code constructs a distance matrix where distance[a][b] is the shortest
distance between nodes a and b. First, the algorithm initializes distance using
the adjacency matrix adj of the graph:


for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) 
{
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) 
    {
        if (i == j) distance[i][j] = 0;
        else if (adj[i][j]) distance[i][j] = adj[i][j];
        else distance[i][j] = INF;
    }
}



After this, the shortest distances can be found as follows:

for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      distance[i][j] = min(distance[i][j],distance[i][k]+distance[k][j]);
    }
  }
}


The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n3), because it contains three
nested loops that go through the nodes of the graph.
Since the implementation of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm is simple, the
algorithm can be a good choice even if it is only needed to find a single shortest
path in the graph. However, the algorithm can only be used when the graph is so
small that a cubic time complexity is fast enough.
